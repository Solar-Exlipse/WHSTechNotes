The new cell phone law is a good idea for a law, though it does have some flaws.
One of the many flaws I see in this law is the fact that students can't use their phones during lunch or the passing period, as none of that should be considered class time and should just be considered our own time. Another flaw I see is that simply being in the bathroom could make student be able to break the law and you can't really enforce that. The biggest flaw is the fact that some people need their phones to tell their parents where they are, if they need to get home, or if they feel safe in the school.

We already see that having a virtual payment method-like CashApp-means sometimes, you can get hacked out of alot of money, and in Roblox, it could be easy to scam people out of money then the thing is worth.

If I was in control of the electronic and AI policy in my school, my policy would be that using any sort of AI would be banned, and that in class electronic use(Ie, headphones, phones, etc,) would be banned but you could use your phone in passing period and in the cafeteria

cafeteria. Playing games on the chromebook would be banned in class, but on personal time if you decide to use the the chromebook, games can be played. Most of them would be banned, though.

I did the same Hourofcode activity as yesterday, the Compute It activity because it seems to be the only one that interests me.
