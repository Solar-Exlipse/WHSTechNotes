Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

The new cell phone law is a good idea for a law, though it does have some flaws.
One of the many flaws I see in this law is the fact that students can't use their phones during lunch or the passing period, as none of that should be considered class time and should just be considered our own time. Another flaw I see is that simply being in the bathroom could make student be able to break the law and you can't really enforce that. The biggest flaw is the fact that some people need their phones to tell their parents where they are, if they need to get home, or if they feel safe in the school.

Computer Science could be invaluable since I am always going to need to program and code games if I want to be a game developer. This is because I need to program different games, figure out different ways to code said games, and even find ways I can, hopefully, make the games as fun as possible with the limitations of code.

I would try to use the AI to help others learn how to read. This fits the requirement because the AI is useful in the education quality.

Working at a virtual store for real money is a horrible idea. This is because, given the state of the world, it'll be incredibly easy to scam or hack other people's account to get more money with nothing stopping them. We already see that having a virtual payment method-like CashApp-means sometimes, you can get hacked out of alot of money, and in Roblox, it could be easy to scam people out of money then the thing is worth.

I don't understand why anyone uses '6 7.' in the slightest.

If I was in control of the electronic and AI policy in my school, my policy would be that using any sort of AI would be banned, and that in class electronic use(Ie, headphones, phones, etc,) would be banned but you could use your phone in passing period and in the cafeteria

The Hourofcode acitivity I completed was the activity called Compute It. Compute It shows you code and you have to be the one who does the code using a dot and some circles.
cafeteria. Playing games on the chromebook would be banned in class, but on personal time if you decide to use the the chromebook, games can be played. Most of them would be banned, though.

I did the same Hourofcode activity as yesterday, the Compute It activity because it seems to be the only one that interests me.

In this, my prompt was supposed to make a simple four question quiz with college chemistry questions and have an explanation if the answer to the questions were correct or incorrect. Canva intrepreted it pretty well, giving a good way to see the question and the answers, and even showed how much the quiz-taker got correct even though that wasn't in my prompt. The best interactive parts were the answering the questions into the explanations on why it was correct or not. One thing I could probably do to improve my prompt is to actually try and tell the AI what the quiz is aimed at to make it more engaging to someone who probably wouldn't be enganged to learn about the topic I choose.
