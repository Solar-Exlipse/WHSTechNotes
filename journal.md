Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

The new cell phone law is a good idea for a law, though it does have some flaws.
One of the many flaws I see in this law is the fact that students can't use their phones during lunch or the passing period, as none of that should be considered class time and should just be considered our own time. Another flaw I see is that simply being in the bathroom could make student be able to break the law and you can't really enforce that. The biggest flaw is the fact that some people need their phones to tell their parents where they are, if they need to get home, or if they feel safe in the school.

Computer Science could be invaluable since I am always going to need to program and code games if I want to be a game developer. This is because I need to program different games, figure out different ways to code said games, and even find ways I can, hopefully, make the games as fun as possible with the limitations of code.

I would try to use the AI to help others learn how to read. This fits the requirement because the AI is useful in the education quality.

Working at a virtual store for real money is a horrible idea. This is because, given the state of the world, it'll be incredibly easy to scam or hack other people's account to get more money with nothing stopping them. We already see that having a virtual payment method-like CashApp-means sometimes, you can get hacked out of alot of money, and in Roblox, it could be easy to scam people out of money then the thing is worth.

I don't understand why anyone uses '6 7.' in the slightest.

If I was in control of the electronic and AI policy in my school, my policy would be that using any sort of AI would be banned, and that in class electronic use(Ie, headphones, phones, etc,) would be banned but you could use your phone in passing period and in the cafeteria

The Hourofcode acitivity I completed was the activity called Compute It. Compute It shows you code and you have to be the one who does the code using a dot and some circles.
cafeteria. Playing games on the chromebook would be banned in class, but on personal time if you decide to use the the chromebook, games can be played. Most of them would be banned, though.

I did the same Hourofcode activity as yesterday, the Compute It activity because it seems to be the only one that interests me.

The arefour ways I used technology during the break. The first way was that I was playing my new games on my Nintendo Switch, the second way is that I watched YouTube shorts, the third way is I played games on my phones and I always watched TV

In this, my prompt was supposed to make a simple four question quiz with college chemistry questions and have an explanation if the answer to the questions were correct or incorrect. Canva intrepreted it pretty well, giving a good way to see the question and the answers, and even showed how much the quiz-taker got correct even though that wasn't in my prompt. The best interactive parts were the answering the questions into the explanations on why it was correct or not. One thing I could probably do to improve my prompt is to actually try and tell the AI what the quiz is aimed at to make it more engaging to someone who probably wouldn't be enganged to learn about the topic I choose.

If SNAP runs out of funding, especially with as big as a program as SNAP was, then many people and families run out of food or any way to pay for said food. Technology could help by letting people be able to find the nearest food bank, grocery store or free meal program as well as letting them be able to navigate to the area, and it can also be able to helpful to be able to use tech as a way to see how long the food they are getting can last in an estimate. Some of the biggest challenges with using technology for this is the fact that sometimes, people don't have internet or phones and many people could be considered about the safety and privacy for the people using the technological tools that are hypothetically provided. If I was designing something to help with food insecurity, it would probably be an online 'store' where most of the food would be free, and we would try to be able to deliver to the places they are if they can't come and pick it up from where we were.

Technology changed the way we connect during the holiday by making it easier to celebrate and call when people aren't together with each other. These changes make the holidays better as it helps families connect and celebrate with each other, and they can make it a funnier experience with having special effects on. Developers should make sure the technology doesn't go over family time, as it should respect the privacy because having the technology override the privacy and the emotional part of family bonding.

A real world job that uses drones is drone progamming. Progammers in this job help program what the drone is meant to do and used for. From statistics from Ziprecruiter.com state that the annual median income nation-wide is $116,463. The education required is a Bachlor's or higher in Computer Science or Engineering. I'd love to have this job in the future because it is a job that mixes some of my favorite things: Progamming and drones. It also is a job that seems to be able to be done on my own pace, and that's always a plus for me.

I think a self-driving car would face the problem of not recognising the stop sign on the yellow bus because of the fact that the stop sign is connected a bus, a vehicle that they should be able to drive past even when stopped. The two biggest challenges would be the size of the bus and the AI not recognizing it as an actual stop sign. The second challenge is sself-explanatory, if the AI doesn't recognize it as a stop sign, it won't stop. However, the size of the bus or car would matter because the camera would probably not catch the stop sign due to the size of the bus. If I was a Waymo employee I would try to make an emergency stop whenever there is a stopped bus or try to progam it to do exactly that.

My main plans for winter break is to play games, christmas, and just do stuff.
